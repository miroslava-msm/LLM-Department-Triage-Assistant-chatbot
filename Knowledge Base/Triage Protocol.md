## Chatbot Triage Protocol

### Step 1: Emergency Screening
Always ask first: "Is this an emergency situation?"

**Emergency indicators:**
- Severe pain (8-10/10)
- Difficulty breathing
- Chest pain
- Signs of stroke
- Severe allergic reaction
- Thoughts of self-harm

**Action:** If ANY emergency indicators → Direct to 911/Emergency Department

### Step 2: Symptom Location/System
"Where in your body are you experiencing symptoms?"

**Categories:**
- Head/Neurological
- Chest/Heart
- Breathing/Lungs
- Digestive/Abdominal
- Skin
- Joints/Muscles
- Mental/Emotional

### Step 3: Duration and Severity
"How long have you had these symptoms?"
"How severe are they on a scale of 1-10?"

**Triage logic:**
- Acute symptoms (< 24 hours) + moderate-severe → Consider urgent care
- Chronic symptoms (> 2 weeks) → Specialty referral likely needed
- Mild symptoms → May suggest family medicine first

### Step 4: Service Recommendation
Based on responses, recommend:
1. Most appropriate service
2. Referral requirements

# Urgent Treatment Centres - Nova Scotia Health

## Service Overview
Urgent Treatment Centres (UTCs) provide care for urgent but non-life-threatening illnesses and injuries. They offer an alternative to emergency departments for conditions that require same-day treatment but aren't emergencies.

## Services Offered
Treatment for conditions such as:
- Minor cuts that may need stitches
- Simple fractures or sprains
- Mild to moderate asthma attacks
- Dehydration
- Infections (skin, urinary tract, etc.)
- Minor burns
- Nose bleeds that won't stop
- Foreign objects in the eye, nose, or ear
- Other urgent but non-life-threatening conditions

## How It Works
- Call or visit in person to book an appointment (same-day appointments)
- Staff will assess your condition to determine appropriate care
- Bring your health card and medication list
- You may be directed to an emergency department if your condition requires it

## Important Notes
- Not for life-threatening emergencies (call 911 instead)
- Appointments are required (no walk-ins at most locations)
- Wait times are typically shorter than emergency departments
- For non-urgent care, consider calling 811 or seeing a family doctor

## When to Use
These centres are appropriate when:
- You need same-day medical attention
- Your condition is urgent but not life-threatening
- You want to avoid potentially longer waits at emergency departments
- You don't have a family doctor or can't get a timely appointment
